# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analyis is to analyze all the rideshare data from January to end of April of 2019 and create a compelling visualization.

### Resources

- Python/Jupyter Notebook v3.7.7
- city_data.csv
- ride_data.csv

## Results

Based on the below images, we can see that Urban cities bring in the largest amount of revenue through Fares. While their average fare price is lower than both Rural and Suburban cities; they have the largest demand of rides. Urban cities has over 3 times the volume of rides compared to Rural and Suburban cities combined.

## Summary

Based on the results of this analysis, I would recommend the following:

- To add a few more drivers into Urban cities to account for a higher demand in total rides given in Urban cities. 
- Lowering the average fare price for Rural cities to incentavize more people takeing rides in Rural cities. 
- Adding geological data to figure out where the majority of rides are being requested, and increase fare pricing in higher demand areas.
